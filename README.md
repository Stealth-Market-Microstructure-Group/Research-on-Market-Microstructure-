# Market Microstructure Research

## About this Initiative
We are an independent research group focused on the structural dynamics of modern financial markets. Our work combines quantitative modeling with a robust, proprietary simulation framework to analyze market phenomena that are often inaccessible through purely theoretical methods.

## Methodology
Our approach is intentionally multi-disciplinary, integrating concepts from:
- **Market Microstructure Theory:** Building upon and extending foundational models (e.g., Treynor, Glosten-Milgrom) to better reflect contemporary market conditions.
- **Econometrics & Statistics:** Applying rigorous statistical analysis to high-frequency data.
- **Systems Engineering:** Understanding the impact of latency, data flow, and exchange architecture.
- **Regulatory & Legal Frameworks:** Analyzing how market rules and enforcement actions shape participant behavior.

All hypotheses are validated against a proprietary simulation environment built to replay historical ITCH data. During the buildout of our primary Kafka pipeline, we supplement our analysis with custom data acquisition tools.

## Current Research Focus
Our active areas of investigation include:
- The mechanics of dealer markets and hot-potato trading dynamics.
- Modeling and detection of illegal spoofing and layering strategies.
- The formation and behavior of liquidity queues in limit order books.
- Analysis of foundational models and there connection with current advanced markets.

## The Group
Our team's composition includes members with deep domain experience in proprietary trading, low-latency systems development, and quantitative research. This structure allows us to approach problems from both a practitioner's and a researcher's perspective.
